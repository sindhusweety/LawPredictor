Personal Legal Counsellor and Interpreter of the Law
====================================================

Any major transaction, legal procedure, patent dispute always require an attorney-at-law in
the due process. However, the cost of seeking such legal counselling or hiring a lawyer is
often astronomical for everyday people. Even though there are always legitimate cases of
people who fall victims to unjust treatment; contractual violation; patent infringement; and
etc, these victims often do not have the financial resources to seek justice through legal
counselling.

This project is to create an interactive legal counsellor and interpreter of the law for the
disenfranchised. The tool will take in an user-input legal dispute. It will output a
prediction regarding the subject of the law (contract, tort, patent, or etc). The tool will
also provide prior art/relevant cases which have already been decided and are similar to the
dispute at hand. Finally, it will also predict the likelihood of winning/settling of this case
along with any other useful information. Users would receive a vote of confidence regarding
their legal concerns before proceeding with actual legal actions.

The training set to be used for the tool will be legal case briefs (which is public knowledge)
on casebriefs.com and casebriefsummary.com. There are roughly over 3800 case briefs regarding
different subject matters of the law.
